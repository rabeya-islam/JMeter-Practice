# JMeter-Practice
This repository contains a practice project demonstrating the basics of using Apache JMeter for performance testing. The project covers various fundamental aspects of JMeter, including serial execution, the use of Simple Controllers, and the implementation of Test Plan Controllers.

# Project Structure
**Demo Work:** A basic demonstration of JMeter's capabilities, including setting up Thread Groups, configuring HTTP Requests, and using various Listeners to monitor and analyze performance metrics.

**Serial Execution:** This section showcases the sequential execution of different test elements within a JMeter test plan. It demonstrates how to configure JMeter to run tests in a specific order to simulate realistic user behavior.

**Simple Controller:** An example of using the Simple Controller to group test elements logically. This practice helps in organizing test plans, making them easier to manage and understand.

**Test Plan Controller:** This part of the project demonstrates how to utilize the Test Plan Controller to execute different test plans conditionally or in a specific sequence. It shows how to modularize your JMeter tests for better reusability and organization.
